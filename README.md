# Public Write-Up-CTF Repository

## Who We Are
We are a group of cybersecurity enthusiasts and students passionate about learning and growing our skills in ethical hacking, penetration testing, and cybersecurity challenges. Our team collaborates to solve Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges on platforms like Hack The Box, TryHackMe, and Root Me, as well as during online CTF competitions.

## Purpose of This Repository
This repository is dedicated to showcasing our completed write-ups for CTF challenges and competitions. We aim to:
- Document our problem-solving processes for personal and professional growth.
- Share knowledge with the wider cybersecurity community.
- Demonstrate our technical skills and learning journey to potential recruiters and collaborators.

## About Our Private Repository
In addition to this public repository, we maintain a private repository for write-ups of active challenges or challenges not yet approved for public sharing.  
- **Transition to Public Repository**: Once a challenge becomes retired or is explicitly approved for public sharing, the corresponding write-up is reviewed and transferred from the private repository to this public repository.  
This ensures compliance with ethical guidelines while preserving the integrity of active challenges.

## Legal and Ethical Considerations
We are committed to adhering to the ethical guidelines and terms of service of the platforms and events we participate in. To that end:
- **Retired Challenges Only**: This repository contains write-ups for retired challenges or challenges explicitly permitted for public sharing.
- **No Active Challenge Solutions**: We do not publish solutions to active challenges to respect the learning experience of others.
- **Acknowledgments**: Credit is given to the platforms, event organizers, and challenge creators for their work and effort in developing these challenges.
- **Educational Purpose**: All content shared here is strictly for educational purposes and must not be used for malicious activities.
